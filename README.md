GRASP Offline Processor
=======================

GRASP is a data collection tool developed by WFP compatible with XForms.

This utility helps to directly process the XML questionnaires stored inside the
data directory of the application and generates a simple CSV file that could be
imported to data processing and analisys tools.

GRASP is capable of transmitting questionnaires results via Internet or SMS
but in case that an offline tool is needed or there is no cellphone coverage
the questionnaires can be copied to an USB stick and can be processed later
in a offline matter.
